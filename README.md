# LADX-TimerHack
A Room Timer Hack for The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX

Can be applied over a savestate patch, based on [mattcurie's project](https://github.com/mattcurrie/gb-save-states). The source code to create one with that project for this game is included in this repository (also rebinds the savestate hotkeys to up+select and down+select).
